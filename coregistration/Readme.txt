The automated anatomical parcellation AAL3 of the spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution T1 volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). This includes the original parcellation provided in AAL (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al 2002), the new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex provided in AAL2 (Rolls, Joliot, and Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2015) , but also new areas, as described in this User Guide and by (Rolls et al., 2019).
